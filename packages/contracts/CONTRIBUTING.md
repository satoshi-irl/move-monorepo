A new branch should be opened for every function being changed.

Naming of the new branch should have the name of the function being changed
e.g., "submitVote-fix-v1"

Add comments in code and commit summary to describe changes.

Once, something is working, then make a PR.

In the PR, request review.

If a PR passes review, then merge, delete branch.
